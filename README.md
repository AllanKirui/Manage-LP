## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Give your CSS superpowers
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

### What I learned

I learned how to Google more for things I had a hard time implementing and to find solutions to any problems I encountered.

Halfway done with the project, I discovered the [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) plugin.

Adding the plugin with the one line of code below to my project, really saved me a tonne of time coding the sliders on my own.

This, in turn, resulted in some beautiful and highly customizable sliders.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/flickity@2/dist/flickity.pkgd.min.js"></script>
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning CSS grid and writing more semantic code in future projects.

### Useful resources

Resources I found most helpful while building this challenge:

-  [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Resources for developers, by developers. Don't know what the _transform_ property does? Or what the difference between _position: relative_ and _position: absolute_ are? Then, the MDN Docs will clear things up for you.

-  [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A Complete Guide to Grid. The name says it all. If you want to understand CSS Grid much better, this is the article to read.

-  [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) - Touch, responsive, flickable carousels. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a hard time implementing sliders in their projects.

-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. For this project, I loaded the project designs into Inkscape and used it's in-built tools to figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project.

Going through such resources to look up things I didn't understand or know has made me better prepared to tackle future projects.
